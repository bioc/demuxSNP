This package is designed to assist in demultiplexing scRNAseq data, especially in datasets with suboptimal staining quality. 
The SNP profiles from cells confidently labelled using cell hashing demultiplexing methods are used to train a classifier to assign miscalled or uncalled cells with poor hashing quality.
